## üîê Security Limitations

### No Absolute Security

**UNDERSTAND THAT:**
- No cryptographic system is 100% unbreakable
- Implementation bugs may exist despite best efforts
- Social engineering and endpoint security remain vulnerabilities
- Quantum computing may eventually threaten current encryption
- Traffic analysis may reveal communication patterns

### User Security Responsibilities

**YOU MUST:**
- Keep your devices secure and updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Verify security codes through out-of-band channels
- Understand the risks of your communication environment
- Follow operational security (OPSEC) best practices

---

## üèõÔ∏è Freedom of Speech Support

### Our Mission

SecureBit.chat is developed to support:
- **Article 19** of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- **Freedom of expression** and **right to privacy**
- **Resistance to censorship** and mass surveillance
- **Protection of journalists, activists, and dissidents**

### Ethical Use Commitment

We believe privacy and free speech are fundamental human rights, but:
- These rights come with responsibilities
- Freedom of speech does not include freedom from consequences
- Users must respect the rights and safety of others
- Illegal activity is never justified, regardless of privacy tools used
