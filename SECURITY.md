- **Perfect Forward Secrecy:** Automatic key rotation every 5 minutes with secure key versioning
- **Non-extractable Keys:** All cryptographic keys are hardware-protected and non-exportable
- **Enhanced Replay Protection:** Multi-factor protection with sequence numbers, message IDs, and timestamps

### Advanced Traffic Obfuscation
- **Packet Padding:** Random padding (64-512 bytes) to hide real message sizes
- **Anti-Fingerprinting:** Advanced traffic pattern obfuscation and timing randomization
- **Fake Traffic Generation:** Invisible decoy messages for traffic analysis protection

### Enhanced Security Architecture
- **Zero-trust Model:** No central servers to compromise
- **P2P Direct:** WebRTC encrypted channels with enhanced validation
- **No Data Persistence:** Messages exist only in memory, automatic cleanup
- **Enhanced Rate Limiting:** 60 messages/minute, 5 connections/5 minutes with cryptographic verification
- **Session Security:** 64-byte salts, unique session IDs, and replay attack prevention
- **MITM Protection:** Out-of-band verification codes with enhanced validation
